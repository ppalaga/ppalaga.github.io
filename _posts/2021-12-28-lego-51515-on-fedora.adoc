:page-summary: How to program LEGO 51515 alias Robot Inventor in Python on Fedora
:sectanchors:

My 13 years old son Vítek just got https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/robot-inventor-51515[LEGO 51515 (a.k.a. Robot Inventor)] for Christmas.
He assessed the Scratch programming in the Android app as "limiting" after playing with it for a couple of hours and he uttered a wish to try Python.
Unfortunately, Lego does not provide any tools for Linux, the the main OS used within our family.
So we started to look for workarounds.

All steps mentioned here were done on Fedora 34.

First we tried https://github.com/smr99/lego-hub-tk[LEGO Hub Toolkit] by Steven M. Robbins which worked for us only through USB but not via Bluetooth.

Peter Staev's https://github.com/PeterStaev/lego-spikeprime-mindstorms-vscode[LEGO SPIKE Prime / MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor VS Code Extension] offered the best experience so far.

== How to install LEGO SPIKE Prime / MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor VS Code Extension

Of course you need VS Code first.

=== Install VS Code

If you want the newest version, getting the 64 bit `.tar.gz` flavor from https://code.visualstudio.com/download#[VS Code downloads page] might be the safest choice.

Unpack it, once you have downloaded it to `~/Downloads`:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd ~/bin
$ tar xfz ~/Downloads/code-stable-x64-*.tar.gz
----

Add the `code` executable to `PATH` environment variable so that you can open any folder using `code .`

Open the `~/.bashrc` file with `kwrite` or any other text editor

[source,shell]
----
$ kwrite ~/.bashrc
----

and add the following line somewhere around the beginning of the file

[source,shell]
----
export PATH="$HOME/bin/VSCode-linux-x64/bin:$PATH"
----

Save and close the `~/.bashrc` file.

Then create a new directory for your Python experiments and open VS Code in that directory:

[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p ~/code/python
$ cd ~/code/python
$ code .
----

=== Install the LEGO SPIKE Prime / MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor Extension

In VS Code, open the Extensions view by hitting `CTRL+SHIFT+x`.
Then type `lego spike` in the search field, select the found `LEGO SPIKE Prime / MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor Extension`
and click the blue `Install` button to install it.


=== Connect via USB

First let's try connecting via USB.

For this to work on my Fedora 34, I had to add the current user to dialout group.
Otherwise I was getting the `Permission denied: '/dev/ttyACM0'` error when connecting.

[source,shell]
----
$ sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
----

You'll possibly need to restart VS Code or even re-login for the new group membership to get effective.

Then you can connect the USB cable - one end to the Lego HUB and the other end to your computer.

At the bottom of the VS Code window, click the blue `LEGO Hub: Disconnected` area

image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/lego-hub-disconnected.png["LEGO Hub: Disconnected"]

This should let you select the device you want to connect:

image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/select-device.png["Select device"]

Select `/dev/ttyACM0` for USB.

Once the connection succeeds, a couple of new buttons should appear at the top of the VS Code window:

image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/extension-buttons.png["Lego Hub Extension buttons"]

These allow you to

* Start an already uploaded program
* Stop the currently running program
* Upload the current file (in VS Code) to the Hub
* Show the Hub's terminal where you can i.a. see the error messages if something goes wrong with your little program

=== Hello world!

Let's try to write some simple program to make sure that the connection really works.

Create a new file named `test.py` in the `~/code/python` folder and paste the following into the editor:

[source,python]
----
# LEGO type:standard slot:5 autostart
import hub
hub.sound.beep(800, 2000, 0)
----

The first line is specific to the extension and its meaning is documented in the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterStaev.lego-spikeprime-mindstorms-vscode#automatic-uploadstart-of-a-python-file[extension's README].

Once you have saved the file, you can hit the ⭮ button to upload and autostart it to the hub.

You should hear a two seconds beep if everything works correctly.

=== Bluetooth

To test the Bluetooth connection, first disconnect the USB by clicking the blue `LEGO Hub: Connected` area at the bottom of the VS Code window. Then unplug the USB cable.

Make sure Bluetooth is on on your PC e.g. by clicking the Blueman applet icon in the system tray.
If it shows an option "Turn Bluetooth Off", then your Bluetooth is apparently on :-)

image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/blueman-bt-on.png["Bluetooth is on"]

Then pair the hub:

* Click the Blueman applet icon in the system tray and click "Devices"
+
image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/blueman-applet-devices.png["Blueman -> Devices"]
+
* Make sure the Lego Hub is on and press the Bluetooth button on the Hub.
  The Bluetooth button on the Hub should start flashing blue and you should hear some beeping.
* Then start scanning for BT devices by pressing "Search" in the Blueman Devices window
+
image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/blueman-devices-search.png["Blueman Devices -> Search"]
+
* After a while a device named "LEGO Hub <Mac address>" should appear in the list of devices:
+
image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/lego-hub-found.png["Lego hub found"]
+
* Open its context menu by right-clicking it and click "Pair"
+
image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/bt-pair-device.png["Pair the device"]

==== Initial serial connection

Once the device is paired, create a an initial serial connection with the device using Blueman that we will disconnect right away.
I am not quite sure why this is necessary.
I guess it creates the `/dev/rfcomm0` device that persists after disconnecting and which the VS Code extension is not able to do itself for some reason.

* Right-click the Hub in Devices window and click "Connect to: Serial Port"
+
image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/bt-serial-port.png["Connect to serial port"]
+
* Once the connection succeeds the Bluetooth button on the Hub should stop flashing and should start shining blue without interruptions.
* Make sure the the `rfcomm` device was created:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ ps -Af | grep /dev/rfcom
ppalaga     4852    3657  0 14:27 ?        00:00:00 /usr/bin/python3 /usr/libexec/blueman-rfcomm-watcher /dev/rfcomm0
----
+
* Note the index of the device - it is `rfcomm0` in our case, but it could be `rfcomm1` or something else in your case.
* Disconnect the serial port via Blueman applet menu:
+
image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/disconnect-serial-port.png["Disconnect the serial connection"]

These initial serial connection steps need to be performed after every restart of the computer.

==== Connect via Bluetooth from VS Code

* Get back to VS Code and click the blue `LEGO Hub: Disconnected` area
+
image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/lego-hub-disconnected.png["LEGO Hub: Disconnected"]
+
* This should let you select the device to connect to.
* If you are lucky, you see `/dev/rfcomm0` with the exact index returned by `ps -Af | grep /dev/rfcomm` above.
* If your device is not there in the list, just type it manually.
+
image::/images/2022/2021-12-28-lego-51515-on-fedora/select-rfcomm0.png["Select /dev/rfcomm0"]
* After that, the connection should succeed and the Bluetooth button on the Hub should start shining blue.

==== Upload and run a test program

To test, whether it works, you can do some change in the `test.py` program, e.g. prolong the duration of the beep from `2000` to `5000` milliseconds:

[source,python]
----
# LEGO type:standard slot:5 autostart
import hub
hub.sound.beep(800, 5000, 0)
----

After saving the file, you can hit the ⭮ button to upload and autostart it to the Hub.

You should hear a five seconds beep if everything works correctly.

That's it for making the Hub work on Fedora. I hope I was able to save you some time.

I am looking forward to your feedback via https://twitter.com/ppalaga[Twitter]!
