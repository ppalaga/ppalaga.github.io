Me and my team are continuing to work on amazing
https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-cxf/dev/index.html[Quarkus CXF] and
https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/index.html[Camel Quarkus].
Today, we started doing it under the IBM umbrella.
I feel even more committed to stability and quality.
Nothing changes w.r.t. our overall upstream first strategy.
Regardless of the re-org, we will keep working on Red Hat Build of Quarkus, Red Hat Build of Quarkus Apache Camel
and other products further offered by Red Hat.
